# Age-Calculator

I created an age calculator that allows users to enter their birth date and get to see how old they are. The user inputs their birthdate via a JavaScript Datepicker, and the app calculates and displays their exact age, including years, and months using Luxon. https://roadmap.sh/projects/age-calculator
